## **Project Overview**  

This repository documents the **LoRaWAN-based integration of BME280 environmental sensors**, comparing **The Things Network (TTN)** and **ChirpStack** for real-time data transmission. The insights from this study contribute to the **Gladiolen Smart Waste Management Project**, which monitors **waste bin levels and locations** using **ultrasonic sensors and LoRaWAN communication**.  

Key topics covered:  
- Step-by-step integration of BME280 sensors with **TTN** and **ChirpStack**  
- Feasibility analysis of both LoRaWAN networks  
- Recommendations for implementing LoRa-based waste monitoring  

**Full documentation available in this repository.**
